# NetSpeedTest

this project is server for https://github.com/ap-performance-test/AP-Performance-Test-Front.git

## Technology Stack

- Framework: Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
- Cloud Storage: Google Cloud Storage
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions, AWS EC2

when frontend tests network speed(upstream, downstream, ping, jitter ...), server provide these link

- /garbage: router to estimate downstream
- /empty: router to estimate upstream, ping ,jitter
- /getIP: router to provide user's IP address

application of measured data can be achived through api

- /api/speedtest
- /api/speedtest_by_day?day=${day}

cache server api

- /api/pulse_cnt

and save speedtest's data with user's data in mongodb running in docker container

## Getting Started

1. How to clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/ap-performance-test/NetSpeedTest.git

docker-compose up
```

2. How to run the server locally using Docker and docker-compose

- Note: For local development, you should use the docker-compose.local.yml file.

```yml
# set these variables indocker_compose.local.yml

MONGO_URI=mongodb://testuser:testpassword@mongodb:27017/testdb
CLIENT_IP=http://172.30.1.30:5173
```

- For the MONGO_URI, the following environment variables are used:

```dockerfile
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=root
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=example
MONGO_USER=testuser
MONGO_PASSWORD=testpassword
MONGO_DB_NAME=testdb
```
